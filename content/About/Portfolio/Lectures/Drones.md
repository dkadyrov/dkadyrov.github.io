## Title

The Drone Dilemma: Balancing Innovation with Security in the Age of Autonomous Flight

## Description

The rapid proliferation of drones with their increased capabilities and decreasing cost, have found their way into civilian, commercial, and military industries. Although the unmanned aerial technology has assisted in photography and agriculture, the same off the shelf systems have been used in the battlefields and in areas of conflict. Policies and licenses have been set in place by governments around the world but engineering solutions are being developed to leverage cameras, radar, acoustic, radio-frequency, and AI technology to detect, classify, and mitigate against undesirable drone usage. This lecture will explore the current state of drone technology and its benevolent and nefarious applications, the laws that attempt to regulate them, and the counter systems that have been created to monitor and defend against them.

The rapid proliferation of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), commonly known as drones, has permeated diverse sectors, including civilian, commercial, and military domains. While UAS technology has revolutionized fields such as photography and precision agriculture, it has also raised security concerns. Even off-the-shelf drone systems, once confined to peaceful applications, now find themselves on battlefields and in conflict zones. Although policies and licenses have been set in place by governments around the world, engineering solutions are being developed to leverage cameras, radar, acoustic, radio-frequency, and AI technology to detect, classify, and mitigate against undesirable drone usage. This lecture will explore the current state of drone technology and its benevolent and nefarious applications, the laws that attempt to regulate them, and the counter systems that have been created to monitor and defend against them.
