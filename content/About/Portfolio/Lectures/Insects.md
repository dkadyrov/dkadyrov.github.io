## Title

Leveraging sensor technology to detect insects in stored food products

## Description

The sight of crawling insects in the cupboard flour container is never a pleasant sight and is the culmination of various moments of infestation that could have occurred at any moment of the stored food product supply chain. Although farmers, transporters, and customs are required to insect their shipments for insects, current methods are mainly through manual human inspection which are labor and time intensive, overlook small insects and eggs, and get overburdened by the large scale of shipments that need to be processed quickly. Beyond damaging and spoiling the food products, the insects entering undetected could be invasive, causing wider economic, environmental, and agricultural problems. This lecture will explore the insects that threaten stored food products, what materials they are found in, and how engineering technologies can be leveraged in order to assist, quicken, and improve the inspection and monitoring.

The presence of crawling insects in the cupboard's flour container is always unpleasant. It is the result of a sequence of infestations that could have happened at any time during the stored food product supply chain. Although farmers, transporters, and customs are required to inspect their shipments for insects, the current methods mainly rely on manual human inspection. This approach is time-consuming and labor-intensive, overlooks small insects and eggs, and may not be sufficient for the vast shipments that need to be processed quickly. Insects that enter undetected could be invasive, causing broader economic, environmental, and agricultural problems. This lecture aims to explore the insects that pose a threat to stored food products, where they are found, and how engineering technologies can help to improve the inspection and monitoring process, making it faster and more efficient.
