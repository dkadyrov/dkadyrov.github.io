What happens if we lose GPS?

## Description

We all joke about how we would be lost if we didn't have GPS on our smartphones but with the recent news of new Russian space-based military capabilities posing a threat to satellites, our society would lose a lot more than the ability to navigate. Developed in the 1970s for the United States military, the global positioning system (GPS) was made publicly available in the 1980s and has since been joined by other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) launched by China, Russia, and the European Union. Although the position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities they provide have been critical to support a wide range of industries, threats and attacks on the system have exposed the vulnerability of this dependence. This lecture will examine the history and science behind GNSS, the technologies and applications that depend on it, threats to the system, and the possible alternatives in a world without GPS.

Many of us rely on GPS technology to navigate our way through life, but recent news about new Russian space-based military capabilities has raised concerns about the safety and security of this technology. GPS was first developed in the 1970s by the United States military, and has since become widely available to the public. It has been joined by other global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) launched by China, Russia, and the European Union. These systems provide position, navigation, and timing (PNT) capabilities that are used in a variety of industries. However, threats and attacks on the system have exposed its vulnerability. In this lecture, we will explore the history and science behind GNSS, the technologies and applications that rely on it, the threats to the system, and possible alternatives in a world without GPS.
