## Instructor Introduction

I start each course introducing myself as an instructor using a presentation I developed using [[ReactJS]]. This presentation gets recycled for use during resume presentations as well. [[ReactJS]] enables vertical slides, which I use to accommodate the level of detail I want to focus on during the presentations. 

The presentation is available here: [[Daniel Kadyrov Presentation]]

## Classroom Introduction

Depending on the class size, I usually set a side a portion of the first day for the students to introduce themselves. If the class is smaller than approximately 15 students, I usually make the students introduce themselves individually. If the class is larger, I create groups and make the students present each other as a group. 

Common questions I ask are: 
- Name
- Where are you from? 
- What are your hobbies or things you enjoy doing?
- What social causes are you passionate about? What is your Roman Empire?
- What is the last tasty thing you ate? 

Virtual courses will have have the following questions: 
- Where are you physically located?

Additionally, I like to ask more topical questions based on the course: 
- What level of experience do you have with Python or programming?
- What field of engineering are you interested in? 

During the [[Introduction to Python]] course, I also send out the [[Introduction to Python Form]] that reiterates the question. This form is used as a dataset to demonstrate Python Data Analysis abilities.
